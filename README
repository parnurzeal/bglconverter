== What is BGLConverter ==
BGLConverter is a cross-platform tool that converts dictionary files into other
formats. Supported formats are BGL, DIC, OPF and MOBI.
It is written in Python. It has both a command line interface and a graphical
interface, written in python/PyQt4.
For the MOBI format, it requires the external tool mobigen_linux, which can be
downloaded from the MobiPocket website.

== Supported input formats ==
* BGL (babylon packed dictionaries)
* Unpacked BGL (called ubgl by me)
* DIC files (subsequent 2-lines entries in a text file, one line for the the
  term, one line for the definition)
* OPF (Open Package File) e-book with MobiPocket extensions


== Supported output formats ==
* Unpacked BGL (see above)
* DIC (see above)
* OPF (see above)
* MOBI (MobiPocket e-book format, here used only for dictionaries)


== Software requirements ==
BGLConverter is divided into 2 tools:
* bglconverter.py, the commandline version
* qtbglconverter.py, the Qt4 GUI

The command line version needs Python (http://www.python.org) 2.5 and greater
to run, just install it and run from a command line. If you don't know what it
is, use the GUI instead.
The GUI needs PyQt4 in order to run. Install the latest version from
* http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download (for PyQt4)
Then just double click on qtbglconverter.py.
I will probably switch to PySide as soon as I will have time for it.
On Microsoft Windows: if you don't want qtbglconverter.py to open a DOS prompt
every time you run it, just rename it to qtbglconverter.pyw.
Charset detection is made by the chardet library.

Tested only on Linux and Windows, it should run also on FreeBSD and Mac OS X,
except for the conversion to the MOBI format, which relies on an external tool
made by MobiPocket.

== Changelog ==
Mar 16, 2009: First public release. Commandline and GUI just work apparently
              fine. Need some fix and improvement, e.g., implement
              multithreading where possible (I don't have control over the
              opf->mobi conversion process, which is the most CPU expensive
              task). Freeze the code into standalone executables who don't
              need Python/Qt4/PyQt4 installed into your system.
